									<h3 class="major heading" style="border-bottom: 1px solid gold;">Introduction</h3>
									<p class="para-font">In a world where convenience and speed are key, bike taxi services like Rydan 
										are transforming the way people commute. But behind every ride lies a story - 
										of customer behavior, service efficiency, revenue patterns, and operational
										 performance. This project dives into those stories using data as the guide.<br><br>
										 The Rydan Bike Taxi Analysis is like a roadmap that uncovers how the business 
										 is doing, why customers cancel rides, which areas bring in the most revenue, 
										 and how riders are performing. By breaking down data into clear trends and 
										 insights, this dashboard empowers decision-makers to understand what's working and what needs a tune-up.<br><br>
										 More than just numbers on a screen, this analysis provides a pulse check on
										the entire operation. It helps the company make smart decisions that 
										improve service quality, boost customer satisfaction, and guide the business in the right direction.</p>
									<h3 class="major heading"style="border-bottom: 1px solid gold;">business problem</h3>
									<p class="para-font">Rydan Bike Taxi lacks clear visibility into customer behavior, cancellation trends, revenue patterns, and vehicle performance. This limits its ability to make smart decisions that improve customer retention, streamline operations, and drive revenue growth.</p>
									
									
<h3 class="major heading" style="border-bottom: 1px solid gold;">Chapter 1: Data preprocessing</h3>
<p class="para-font">Before diving into the dashboards, careful data preprocessing was performed. Unnecessary columns were removed, missing values were handled, and duplicate entries were eliminated. Column names were also cleaned and standardized using Power BI's Power Query Editor to ensure a well-structured dataset for accurate visualizations.</p>
								
									
<h3 class="major heading" style="border-bottom: 1px solid gold;">Chapter 2: overall dashboard</h3>
<p class="para-font">This dashboard gives a quick and easy snapshot of how Rydan is doing. It shows total earnings, number of bookings, and average ride distance. A pie chart breaks down how many rides were completed, canceled, or left unfinished. There's also a daily ride chart that shows clear patterns—some days are super busy, likely weekends or peak days.</p>									</p>

</li>

</li>
</ul>


<h3 class="major heading" style="border-bottom: 1px solid gold;"> Chapter 6: Sql Data Analysis and preparation</h3>
<p class="para-font">Behind the scenes of the dashboard magic, I rolled up my sleeves and dove into over 100k+
ride records using MySQL. I gave the messy data a good cleanup, then crafted smart queries to uncover 
cool patterns like when people love to book rides, how they behave, and where the money flows. 
I turned all that raw data into visuals that actually make sense Thanks! to Power BI.</p>
